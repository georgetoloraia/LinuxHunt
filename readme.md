## Ok this is a my personal game 

- Original code creator is a albertobsd https://github.com/albertobsd/keyhunt/tree/main

### What can my idea do?

- My Python code can generate random Decimal's number in bit 66

- After generate opening keyhunt automatical.

- writing in arguments -r "generated Decimal".

- ./keyhunt -t 1 -m rmd160 -l compress -r [generated Decimal [from to]]

- I think if work 4 hours it is possible

- After 4 hours program stop and generating new random Decimal's
